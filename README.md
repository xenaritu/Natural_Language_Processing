# Natural Language Processing

This repository is dedicated to primarily solving natural language processing problems using deep learning models. 
The repository also contains some unconventional problem solving approaches, for example: Using CNNs for text data i.e.
labeling wiki comments as obscene, toxic, very-toxic, threat insult etc. Another example is using bi-directional LSTM for
image classification. In this case I use bi-directional LSTM model for classifying images in the MNIST dataset.
